            <p><img src="basic-ux/images/03.01.01-data-collection.png"> In this project we were to do different types of research; desktop, observational, interview, and survey. Three of the research styles were done as individuals and the other one, survey, was done in a group. I had previously done some desktop, interview, and survey research in college, but I have not done much of the analysis. That was something new to me, analyzing the research and then putting it in to a presentation. I was given the feedback that I needed to make the information more presentable in future iterations. There were too many words on the slides, and I need to make it more digestible.</p>

            <p><img src="basic-ux/images/03.02.01-content.png"> In this project we found pairs and were asked to interview each other. We were to create content for a mobile website, that would match the needs of our partner and come from a specific sender – in this case, a food blog. We did card sorting and concept mapping. We did some more wireflows and learned about micro copy. I chose to do a food blog because I enjoy cooking and my partner did as well. I found it interesting to have to write in a different tone of voice then I normally do.</p>

            <p><img src="basic-ux/images/03.03.01-prototype.png"> We were put into pairs for this assignment and we were to create a site that would help international students in Copenhagen find jobs, friends, and housing. My partner and I did desk research by looking at other sites for inspiration and things that we did not like. We started working with UX prototyping more extensively, and I found that is something that I really liked. I was in charge of creating the XD prototype for the project.

            <p><img src="basic-ux/images/03.04.01-design-sprint.png"> The design sprint was by far the best week of the entire semester. We were able to work in groups and start to take on serious tasks for a larger project. I was appointed the facilitator. I enjoyed being in charge of the schedule and keeping the team on track. I was also a part of the XD prototyping and the user testing. We created an app for helping people meet up with their friends on a planned and spontaneous basis. It was an intense week, but I thought that it was the most “real world” experience we had in class.
