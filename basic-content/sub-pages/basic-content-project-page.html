            <h2>Thoughts on the theme Animaiton</h2>

            <p>During the process of creating the Campaign Site and pitch our group decided that we wanted to use a story to teach people about how they can use different products in their home to cook even if they seem “ugly” or “old”. During the process we learned about how important location scouting and lighting were. It was a difficult task to accomplish with the time given, but we made due with what we could and created a very informative and engaging video. <p>

                    <h2>Theme Goal:</h2>
                    <p>To create a Campaign Site for Foodsharing Copenhagen that to help educate people to reduce food waste. </p>

                    <h2>Takeaway:</h2>
                    <p>I learned a lot about video production and education in this project. I have not done much filming or editing of video, so I learned a lot of new terms like; dramaturgy, medium shot, smooth cut, hard cut, and cross cut. I learned about editing using color correction and color grading. I also learned about the beginning of the filming process, like writing a theme, logline, and treatment.
