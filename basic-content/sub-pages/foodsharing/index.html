            <h1>Facts</h1>
            <p>
                In Denmark alone, 700,000 tons of food is wasted each year that could have been eaten. The food waste costs Danish consumers more than 11 billion DKK a year. The households waste more than 260,000 tons of food per year and the food industry 133,000 tons. That is why food waste is a huge problem, which is not only expensive, but also exhausting of our resources and our environment.<br><br>

                One of the biggest reasons people throw away food is they don't know the difference between "sell before"(best before), "best by", and "use by" dates. The "use by" date is the one to pay attention to! This date tells you when the food is no longer safe to consume. However, the "sell before" and "best by" dates are actually best guesses as to food quality—not food safety. It is likely perfectly safe to eat for days or weeks after that "sell-by" or "best-by" date has passed. So even if your eggs say they are "best by" a certain date, they don’t suddenly turn rotten at midnight.</p>
