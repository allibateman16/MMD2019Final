            <p><img src="basic-content/images/story-without-words.png"> For this project we were given groups of three. We were to create a video that told story without using any words. During the idea generation we used techniques that we learned during the presentations like S.C.R.A.P., B-roll, natural sound, and sound effects. We decided to make a video about the sounds that happen during class and how they annoyed our main character while she is trying to take notes.</p>

              For our Campaign Site project we were put into groups of four and asked to create a campaign site for Foodsharing Copenhagen. We decided to make our video a story about a woman making food with different foods that are either ugly and slightly "bad" ingredients to show that they are still okay to use.
