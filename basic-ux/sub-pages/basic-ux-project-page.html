        <h2>Thoughts on the theme Basic UX</h2>

        <p>During the design sprint we were able to work as a team to create something that I honestly think would be worth pursuing. We went through so many different steps in such a short week, but it was the most engaged and motivated I have felt during this semester. My role as the facilitator was something that my team asked me to do, but it is something that I am actually really good at and was hoping to do. The facilitatorâ€™s job is to keep the team on track, make sure that the pieces of the project are getting done, and facilitate different aspects of the sprint. Basically keep the team moving forward throughout the week.<p>

                <h2>Theme Goal:</h2>
                <p>To use the Google design sprint method to create a native app idea to improve student life for KEA students.</p>

                <h2>Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>During the design sprint we were asked to adapt to a fast-paced environment where decisions needed to be made quickly, but with thought put in to them. We all had to be functioning at our highest. Working with a team all day for five days was a new experience, but I was lucky to have a great team. We needed to understand all of the steps of the design sprint while simultaneously getting comfortable with creating and testing prototypes.
