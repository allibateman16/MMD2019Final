            <p><img src="basic-animation/images/animation.png"> For this project we learned about sprite animations. I was very ambitious when I started, and I tried to make something that was a little too advanced for the amount of time I had and my skill level at the time. I submitted my project that was not quite finished, but then went back and simplified it and was able to make it work.</p>

                For this project we were learning about javascript and were asked to create 10 buttons that made our character do 10 different things. One of the main goals was to make sure that each time a new button was clicked, the button that was active would turn off. This was difficult, but being able to work on it while in class and with my classmates was a huge help.

            <p><img src="basic-animation/images/github.png"> We learned about what GitHub was and we created our own GitHub account and installed Brackets Git to Brackets. We learned about pulling and pushing and committing our code to repositories so that we could go back to them and use codes and update what we have been working on.

            <p><img src="basic-animation/images/bouncy-ball.png"> For these in-class coding projects we were to find a partner and work with javascript to re-create something from a given project pool. I was not very confident in how javascript worked, and neither was my partner. We both didn't understand loops, arrays, or If, else if, and else statements very well. We were able to make a ball that bounced around in a box and I was honestly very proud of it!

            <p><img src="basic-animation/images/calculator.png"> For this project I was paired with a parter who knew more about javascript and we ended up asking Keld for advice and making this calculator pretty advanced (at least for me)! I was really proud of what we did. I ended up being able to understand (read) javascript well. I am still working on being able to write it well.

            <p><img src="basic-animation/images/onboarding.png"> For this project we were to create an Onboarding for students coming to KEA/Denmark. We made an Onboarding for a student who was deciding if they would like to attend KEA. We wanted to create something that a potential student could watch/play to see what a week at KEA in the MMD program would look like. I was again appointed as the Facilitator, and was in charge of creating the sprite animations, GIF, and some of the smaller graphics. Being the facilitator was definitely a little more of a challenge for this project because there was less structure, so I was in charge of creating the schedule and timeline and making sure that the team stuck to it.
