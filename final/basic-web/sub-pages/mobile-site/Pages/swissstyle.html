            <h2> A HISTORY </h2>
            <section>
                    <p>Also known as the International Typographic Style or the International Style, this style of design originated in Switzerland in the 1940s and 50s.</p>

                <p>One of the most important things that Swiss Design brought to the table was its use of grids to structure content in layouts. The idea behind this approach was to help designers take a consistent and organized approach to page layout. Of course, this fits into the Swiss Design ideology of emphasizing orderliness and readability above all else.
                    The grid became a core concept in the world of design throughout the 20th century and became the standard for corporate design, but this has since declined, its impact is still definitely felt. The poster below shows up in most of the pages when you google the words "Swiss Style Design". However, it is actually a newer piece by an artist in Germany in 2002.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Another big thing that Swiss Design emphasized was its asymmetrical organization of content. Symmetry in art and design often leads to very aesthetically pleasing work at best, and a little “safe” or routine work at worst. Asymmetry on the other hand, usually makes things look active, exciting, and dynamic. Below is a poster by Muller-Brockmann and emphasizes the use of asymmetry.</p>

            <section>
                <p>While Swiss Design certainly focuses on asymmetry, it doesn’t mean that it’s inherently chaotic, proven by Muller-Brockmann's poster above. Remember, the use of a grid was almost mandatory. This allowed for a greater sense of unity and gave more emphasis to the whitespace in the design. This of course, made things appear more clean and minimalistic in aesthetics.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Swiss Design is a influential movement in the world of graphic design. It’s incredibly easy for designers nowadays to think of the things they do and the practices they follow as just being “the way things are,” but it could be argued that it’s important to see where these norms come from.</p>

                <p>Also, being able to identify certain styles of design is important for understanding the places designers and their work come from today. Furthermore, being able to identify styles like this, as well as other design movements, then assessing their similarities and differences can help you get an idea of what works and what doesn’t in your own work.</p>
