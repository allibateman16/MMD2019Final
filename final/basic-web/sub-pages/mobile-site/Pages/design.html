        <h2>COLOR SCHEME</h2>
        <article>
            <section>
                <p> The color scheme that I decided on was not what I was expecting. In my original Project Work Documentation I expressed that I did not think that I would want the bright colors that are associated with Swiss Style Design because I thought that they were too "energetic" and "bold". Below are the colors that I originally chose for my color scheme.</p>

                    <img src="../Images/webiste-design/old-color-scheme.png" alt="Pastel Color Scheme" width="300" height="200" class=border>
                    <figcaption> Old, pastel color scheme
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </center>
            <section>
                <p>After working on my website, I started to realize that the soft colors were getting lost in the bright and bold colors of the images. I made the decision to embrace the bold colors and make use of their attention grabbing brightness for headers.</p>

                    <figcaption> Old, pastel color scheme
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </center>
            <section>
                <p> I also decided that I would make more use of the color black in parts of the design other than text. I created borders around images and boxes so that they stand out from the background.
                    I decided to also make use of white in some of my headers. White space is very important in Swiss Style Design and I wanted to make sure that it was a part of mine as well. This was also a part of my decision to do a fairly simple background, keep the white space there to make other elements stand out.</p>

            <h2>Logos</h2>

            <section>
                <p>My logo ideas are simple, minimalist, and brightly colored. I plan on creating something eye-catching, but not too intricate.
                </p>

            <h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
            <section>
                <p>For the different fonts for my site, I stuck with Helvetica. Since the entirety of Swiss Style Design uses it, I thought that it would be appropriate. I also thought that the fonts Roboto and Raleway had a similar look. I think that Raleway is a bit more "intricate" then Helvetica or Roboto, but it still is clear and concise. All three are very simple, easy to read, but still have a strong presence. </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    I have decided to use Roboto for my Header1's, Raleway for my Header2's, and Helvetica for my body copy. I have given the option of sans-serif for if my fonts are not working on a certain computer because sans-serif is what everyone was using on their Swiss Design posters and media. The website would still have a similar feeling and look if someone's browser couldn't load the fonts.</p>
            </section>

            <h1>Roboto</h1>
            <h2>Raleway</h2>

            <section>
                <p>In the Header1 above you can see that I have added the yellow color to the background to add some pop and made the font color white. Both of these decisions are discussed in the section where I talk about color.</p>

            <h2>Image Assets</h2>
            <section>
                <p>My image assets are three posters that I exported with different compression percentages for use on different sized screens.</p>

            <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
            <aside>
                <p>My folder structure is pretty striaght forward. I like to have as few folders as possible, with well-named files within those folders. It just means less clicking around for me. I know that some people like to break it down even further and have folders within folders to really keep things organized, but I feel (for now at least) that I am able to keep everything organized in this fashion.
