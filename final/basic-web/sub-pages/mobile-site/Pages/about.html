                <p> I am an aspiring designer from Flagstaff, Arizona (USA). I moved to Copenhagen to attend KEA to refine my design skills and learn about UX and UI design. I am 26 years old, I have a bachelor's degree in Communication, and I am engaged as of February this year!

                <p>I was actually really excited when I was assigned the style of Swiss Design. I started to realize that it is something that I use in some of my designs and something that I see used on a daily basis. </p>
                <p>
                    One of the things that I realized immediately is that Google is actually influenced by Swiss Design. I saw the poster below and immediately thought of Google's latest design for their loading screen of the Google Home setup. I like relating my school work to my home life and I thought that it was really interesting that such a huge brand is using ideas like this and I am sure that many others have been influenced as well. I know I have!
