        <h2>Thoughts on the theme Basic Web</h2>

        <p>When doing this project I learned a lot. Coding is something that is completely new to me. I came to the program to learn more about graphic design, not really knowing that there would be so much coding. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the things that we were learning in class. Coding has been a new and cumbersome process. I often get frustrated, but once I am able to execute what my plan was, it is really gratifying.<p>

                <h2>Theme Goal:</h2>
                <p>To build a responsive website (a website with a layout that changes based on the size of the viewport).</p>

                <h2>Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>The design and content of my site were based on Swiss Style which was given to me at the beginning of the project. I followed the basic design principles of Swiss Style from colors to typography which I put in to a style tile. The main idea was to create a site that captured the Swiss Style while keeping in mind the user experience on different devices.
