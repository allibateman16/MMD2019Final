        <p><img src="basic-web/images/alli-bateman_swiss-style-final.jpg"> The moodboard that I created was based on my assigned style which was Swiss Style. Some of the characteristics that I used to create the moodboard were:
            Bright color scheme, typography, specifically the use of Helvetica

    <div class="thumbnail">
    <p><img src="basic-web/images/02.01.02.png"> In the project work documentation I was able to share the knowledge that I gathered about Swiss style and give examples of what the style looked like. I was also able to talk about the process of creating different logos I created for the style and explore what those would look like when I put them in to Photoshop.</p>

I created my first logo for my website, DesignSmith.com and used Adobe XD for the first time. We were also exposed to some of the user testing methods.</p>
