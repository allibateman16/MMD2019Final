        <h2>Thoughts on the theme Animaiton</h2>

        <p>During the Onboarding project we had to employ a lot of what we had learned during the design sprint project. Although we didnâ€™t need to work as quickly as the sprint week, we needed to make sure that we kept moving forward and worked off the decisions that we made. At the beginning of the project, during our planning and idea generating phase, we had a lot of ideas. Having a lot of ideas is a nice problem to have, but we did need to make sure that we knew what direction we wanted the project to move in. We decided to make the Onboarding for potential students who wanted to know what a week in the Multimedia Design Program is like. We made the it with the intention that our Onboarding would be one of many that KEA would have to show what a week in all of their programs is like. We created stickers that the user had to collect throughout the gamified Onboarding and at the end they would receive a badge. We had the idea that every program would have a badge that the users could collect.<p>

                <h2>Theme Goal:</h2>
                <p>To create a gamified web-based Onboarding that helps students who are going to move to Denmark and become a student at KEA in the Multimedia Design Program in some way.</p>

                <h2>Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>Learning about how gamification and storytelling contributed to the Onboarding was a great lesson. When we started the idea generation process I had no idea how the three were going to work together, but once we came up with the idea for our project it all came together really nicely. I learned a lot about really thinking through each piece of the project was important. How each part that we created needed to mean something to the story and the game.
